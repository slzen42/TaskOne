            <h3>Ancient Greek Architecture</h3>
            <p>Ancient Greek architecture is distinguished by its highly formalized characteristics, both of structure and decoration. This is most evident in the temples and public buildings constructed in ancient Greece, such as the Parthenon in Athens and the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.</p>
            <p>The ancient Greeks developed three architectural styles known as orders: the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders. Each order has its unique characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Doric Order:</strong> The Doric order is the simplest and sturdiest. It features plain, saucer-shaped capitals and columns without bases.</li>
                <li><strong>Ionic Order:</strong> The Ionic order is more slender and elegant. It is easily recognized by its scroll-like volutes on the capitals and bases for the columns.</li>
                <li><strong>Corinthian Order:</strong> The Corinthian order is the most ornate, characterized by elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Greek temples were designed to house the cult statue of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated. They were built to be admired from the outside and often positioned on elevated ground for maximum visual impact.</p>
            <p>Besides temples, the Greeks also built theaters, stadiums, and other public buildings. These structures were often designed with careful attention to proportions and symmetry, reflecting the Greeks' appreciation for harmony and balance.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>Ancient Greece</h3>
            <p>Ancient Greece, a civilization that flourished from around the 8th century BCE to the end of antiquity (c. 600 AD), is renowned for its contributions to modern philosophy, politics, art, and science. This period in history gave birth to notable figures such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, whose ideas have shaped Western thought.</p>
            <p>Greek city-states, such as Athens and Sparta, were known for their distinct forms of government and societal structure. Athens is celebrated for establishing democracy, where citizens had the power to vote on legislative matters. Sparta, on the other hand, was a warrior society focused on military training and excellence.</p>
            <p>The cultural achievements of Ancient Greece include monumental works of architecture like the Parthenon, epic literary works such as Homer's "Iliad" and "Odyssey," and the origins of the Olympic Games. These accomplishments have left an enduring legacy on subsequent generations and civilizations.</p>
